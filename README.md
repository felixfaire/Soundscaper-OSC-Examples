# Soundscaper OSC - Demo Examples

Here are some demo examples of how to trigger and control sounds with Soundscaper and Processing using OSC.

### Setup

1. Download and run Soundscaper OSC from [HERE](https://felixfaire.github.io/Soundscaper-OSC/).
2. Load the included 'audio_assets/sound_clips and 'audio_assets/atmosphere' folders in SoundscaperOSC.
2. Open and run one of the examples in Processing. 

These demo files and programs simply demonstrate the OSC control messages to build a soundscape in realtime, they are not particularly beautiful examples of sound scapes that might be possible with these tools!

Hopefully they give you a taste of how the system might allow more complex / interesting sound environments / scenes to be built using other audio samples and types of movement.
